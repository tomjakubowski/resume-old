                I am a self-taught developer seeking to apply my personal experience with writing
                web applications to work on applications in a professional environment. I
                strive to write concise, maintainable code. My language of choice is
                Ruby, but I also have experience with Python and Javascript.
                I am a test-driven development enthusiast.

                <p>
                   I have two years of experience writing scripts and
                   applications in Ruby and Python. I have worked
                   independently with the Rails and Sinatra web frameworks for
                   about one year, using Git for source control and RSpec/Webrat for
                   unit and integration testing. I am familiar with SASS,
                   HAML, ERB, and Markdown for DRY styling and templates. I
                   have a working knowledge of RVM, Bundler, and Rubygems. I
                   have some past experience with JavaScript (jQuery) and
                   Python.
                </p>

                <h2>Personal skills</h2>
                <p>
                   I am a keen problem solver. When appropriate, I like to take new,
                   experimental approaches to problems, but will not shy away from
                   well-established ones. I am always looking for something new to learn
                   about and try out. I work very well as part of a small team, and pick
                   up skills and adapt to changes rapidly.
