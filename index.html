                <h2>Technical skills</h2>
                <p>
                    I have about four months of experience developing websites
                    and back-end APIs with PHP, and have written several web
                    applications over the past two years in Ruby using Rails
                    and Sinatra. On the front-end, I am familiar with Javascript
                    and jQuery-like frameworks, including Zepto for mobile
                    development. I am also quite capable with CSS and SCSS.
                </p>

                <h2>Personal skills</h2>
                <p>
                   I am a keen problem solver. Where appropriate, I like to take new,
                   experimental approaches to problems, but will not shy away from
                   well-established ones. I am always looking for something new to learn
                   about and try out. I work very well as part of a small team, and pick
                   up skills and adapt to changes rapidly.
